Usage: The Program generates a randomly-generated array of size `MAX`. `MAX` is found in the main.cpp file. By default, this is set to 128. However, the files should, theoretically, be capable of supporting arrays of countably infinite size. Also in the main.cpp file, the variable `lineamt` can be changed to increase or decrease the number of items shown per line when printed. By default, this is set to 16.
